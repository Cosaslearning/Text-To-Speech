This project is a web-based Text-To-Speech converter that allows users to enter text and convert it into spoken words. The code is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a user-friendly interface for text input and voice selection. Below, we will explain the code structure and functionality.

**HTML File (index.html):**

- The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page for a Text-To-Speech (TTS) converter.
- It includes references to external resources like the Font Awesome icon library and external CSS and JavaScript files.
- The page includes a container, header, and a section for text input, voice selection, and conversion buttons.

**CSS File (style.css):**

- The CSS file contains styles optimized for the Text-To-Speech project.
- It defines base styling for fonts, variable definitions for colors, and styling for the container, header, and heading.
- The CSS also includes styling for the Text-To-Speech section, including input fields, buttons, and the use of CSS variables.

**JavaScript File (script.js):**

- The JavaScript file contains the logic for the Text-To-Speech functionality.
- It defines variables to access HTML elements like the textarea, voice selection, and buttons.
- The script initializes the speech synthesis and dynamically loads available voices.
- It handles input events, including clearing text, selecting voices, and controlling speech playback based on user interactions.


This web application allows users to enter text and convert it into speech using the browser's Text-To-Speech capabilities. The code structure and styling are optimized for user-friendly interaction. It provides options to select voices, control playback, and clear text input for a complete TTS experience. The code is well-commented for clarity and ease of understanding.
